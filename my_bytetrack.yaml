# Ultralytics YOLO ByteTrack Hyperparameters
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage: model.track(source=0, tracker='my_bytetrack.yaml')

tracker_type: bytetrack  # tracker type, ['botsort', 'bytetrack']

# --- Primary Thresholds ---
track_high_thresh: 0.5   # Threshold for the first association (high confidence detections)
track_low_thresh: 0.1    # Threshold for the second association (low confidence detections)
new_track_thresh: 0.6    # Threshold for starting a brand new track
match_thresh: 0.8        # IoU threshold for matching boxes between frames

# --- Memory & Persistence ---
track_buffer: 30         # How many frames to "remember" an object after it disappears
                         # Increase this if objects are frequently hidden (occlusion)

# --- Scenario-Based Tuning Guide ---

# Scenario A: IDs are flickering/changing on the same object
# -> Problem: Model confidence is dipping slightly.
# -> Solution: Lower 'track_low_thresh' to 0.05.

# Scenario B: Object goes behind something and gets a new ID when it reappears
# -> Problem: Memory buffer is too short.
# -> Solution: Increase 'track_buffer' to 60 or 100 frames.

# Scenario C: Moving objects "swap" IDs when they pass each other
# -> Problem: Spatial matching is too loose.
# -> Solution: Lower 'match_thresh' to 0.6 or 0.7 to be more strict.

# Scenario D: Seeing "Ghost" IDs (false detections getting tracked)
# -> Problem: System is too eager to start new tracks.
# -> Solution: Increase 'new_track_thresh' to 0.7 or 0.8.
